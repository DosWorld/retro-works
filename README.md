Works of Retro Programming
==========================

Some retro programming works for some old platforms.

Old platforms used are as follows:

### GW-BASIC

A simple BASIC environment.

### MS-DOS 5.0 + ANSI.SYS + UCDOS

A simple telnet environment with Chinese display and input.

### MS-DOS 5.0 + UCDOS + TX.COM

An environment use `TX.COM` to display Chinese characters in different sizes and styles.

`TX.COM` is shipped along with UCDOS. Commands for `TX.COM` are generated at server side, then transmitted via a virtual serial line in DOSBox.
